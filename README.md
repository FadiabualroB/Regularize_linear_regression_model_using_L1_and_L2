Regularize linear regression model using L1 and L2


Download the House Price Prediction dataset from the following Kaggle link:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
the test set of the dataset does not have “y” class label, so you will use the “y” label from
the following solution:
https://www.kaggle.com/pallavipatial/house-price-prediction/data
You are required to do the following:
1- Use linear regression model to solve the problem (do all steps that we used in the
first assignment: tuning alpha and number of iterations and use plotting to show
your tuning).
2- Investigate if you can use linear function, or you need to use quadratic/cubic
functions.
3- Test your trained model on the test dataset and show your results with cost
function.
4- Improve your model using regularization technique:
a. Tune your lambda values for L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) and show the
results of your tuning with plotting.
b. Compare L1 with L2 and show their results and select the best one.
5- Test your regularized model on the test dataset and show your results with cost
function and compare it with before and after regularization.
6- Submit your results of test dataset to Kaggle and share the link of your submission
and score.
7- Submit a report of your finding and analysis along with the source code.
